                "I served 32 years in the military and daily physical training was a way of life for me. Until retirement 9 years ago, I was always in great physical shape. I knew I had to fix my diet first. I immediately cut out energy drinks, soda, salt, cheese, caffeine, processed food, bad carbohydrates & sugar."
